# Beyond the x and y aesthetics

Switch focus to exploring aesthetic mappings, instead of geoms. 

## Shapes


- Try a scatterplot of `gdpPercap` vs `pop` with a categorical variable (continent) as `shape`.

```{r}
gvsl <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    scale_x_log10() 
gvsl + geom_point(aes(shape=continent), alpha=0.2)
```


- As with all (?) aesthetics, we can also have them _not_ as aesthetics!
    - Try some shapes: first as integer from 0-24, then as keyboard characters.
    - What's up with `pch`?

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(shape = 7)
gvsl + geom_point(pch = 7)
gvsl + geom_point(pch = "$")
```


List of shapes can be found [at the bottom of the `scale_shape` documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_shape.html).

## Colour

Make a scatterplot. Then:

- Try colour as categorical variable.

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = continent))
```

- Try `colour` and `color`. 
- Try colour as numeric variable.
    - Try `trans="log10"` for log scale.

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = pop)) + scale_colour_continuous(trans="log10")
gvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = lifeExp > 60))
```


Make a line plot of `gdpPercap` over time for all countries. Colour by `lifeExp > 60` (remember that `lifeExp` looks bimodal?)


Try adding colour to a histogram. How is this different?

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = continent))
```


## Facetting

Make histograms of `gdpPercap` for each continent. Try the `scales` and `ncol` arguments. 


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = "free_x") +
  geom_histogram()
```

Remove Oceania. Add another variable: `lifeExp > 60`. 

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap)) +
  facet_grid(continent ~ lifeExp > 60) +
  geom_histogram()
```


## Bubble Plots

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(aes(size = pop), alpha=0.2) + 
  scale_size_area() #cahnges size to rep. magnitude of numeric variable
```


- Add a `size` aesthetic to a scatterplot. What about `cex`?
- Try adding `scale_radius()` and `scale_size_area()`. What's better?
- Use `shape=21` to distinguish between `fill` (interior) and `colour` (exterior).

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(aes(size = pop, fill = continent), 
                  shape=21, colour ="black", alpha=0.2)
```

## "Complete" plot

Let's try plotting much of the data.

- gdpPercap vs lifeExp with pop bubbles
- facet by year
- colour by continent

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point(aes(size=pop, colour = continent)) +
  scale_size_area() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```



# Continue from last time (geom exploration with `x` and `y` aesthetics)

## Path plots

Let's see how Rwanda's life expectancy and GDP per capita have evolved over time, using a path plot.

- Try `geom_line()`. Try `geom_point()`.
- Add `arrow=arrow()` option.
- Add `geom_text`, with year label. 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Rwanda") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  #scale_x_log10() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path(arrow = arrow()) #connects the dots
```


## Two categorical variables

Try `cyl` (number of cylinders) ~ `am` (transmission) in the `mtcars` data frame.

- Scatterplot? Jitterplot? No.
- `geom_count()`.
- `geom_bin2d()`. Compare with `geom_tile()` with `fill` aes.

```{r}
mtcars
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), factor(am))) +
#  geom_count()
# or geom_jitter tho besty is!
  geom_bin2d()
```


## Overplotting

Try a scatterplot with:

- Alpha transparency.
- `geom_hex()`
- `geom_density2d()`
- `geom_smooth()`

```{r}
gvsl + geom_hex()
```
```{r}
gvsl + geom_density2d()
##heatmap = change scale ??
```

```{r}
gvsl + geom_smooth() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + geom_smooth(method = "outline")
```

## Bar plots

How many countries are in each continent? Use the year 2007.

1. After filtering the gapminder data to 2007, make a bar chart of the number of countries in each continent. Store everything except the geom in the variable `d`.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=continent)) +
  geom_bar()
```


2. Notice the y-axis. Oddly, `ggplot2` doesn't make it obvious how to change to proportion. Try adding a `y` aesthetic: `y=..count../sum(..count..)`.



__Uses of bar plots__: Get a sense of relative quantities of categories, or see the probability mass function of a categorical random variable.



## Polar coordinates

- Add `coord_polar()` to a scatterplot.

```{r}
gvsl + geom_point() + coord_polar()
#maybe use this for your smolt data
```

# Want more practice?

If you'd like some practice, give these exercises a try

__Exercise 1__: Make a plot of `year` (x) vs `lifeExp` (y), with points coloured by continent. Then, to that same plot, fit a straight regression line to each continent, without the error bars. If you can, try piping the data frame into the `ggplot` function.

UGLY GRAPH:
```{r}
yvsl <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp)) 
yvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = continent))
```


```{r}
yvsl <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp)) 
yvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(colour = continent))
```


__Exercise 2__: Repeat Exercise 1, but switch the _regression line_ and _geom\_point_ layers. How is this plot different from that of Exercise 1?

```{r}
yvsl <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp)) 
yvsl + geom_point(aes(colour = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(colour = continent))
```

__Exercise 3__: Omit the `geom_point` layer from either of the above two plots (it doesn't matter which). Does the line still show up, even though the data aren't shown? Why or why not?

```{r}
yvsl <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp)) 
yvsl + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(colour = continent))
```

__Exercise 4__: Make a plot of `year` (x) vs `lifeExp` (y), facetted by continent. Then, fit a smoother through the data for each continent, without the error bars. Choose a span that you feel is appropriate.

```{r}
yvsl + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

__Exercise 5__: Plot the population over time (year) using lines, so that each country has its own line. Colour by `gdpPercap`. Add alpha transparency to your liking. 

```{r}
pvsy <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, pop))
pvsy + geom_smooth()
```


__Exercise 6__: Add points to the plot in Exercise 5.
