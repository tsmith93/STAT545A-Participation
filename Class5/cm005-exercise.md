```r
library(gapminder)
```


1. Load the `gapminder` and `tidyverse` packages. Hint: `suppressPackageStartupMessages()`!
    - This loads `dplyr`, too.
    
2. `knit` the document. 

## `select()`

1. Make a data frame containing the columns `year`, `lifeExp`, `country` from the gapminder data, in that order.


```r
mydata <- gapminder %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp, country)
```


2. Select all variables, from `country` to `lifeExp`. 


```r
gapminder %>% 
  select(country:lifeExp)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,704 x 4
##    country     continent  year lifeExp
##    <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>
##  1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8
##  2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3
##  3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0
##  4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0
##  5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1
##  6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4
##  7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9
##  8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8
##  9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7
## 10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8
## # ... with 1,694 more rows
```


3. Select all variables, except `lifeExp`.

4. Put `continent` first. Hint: use the `everything()` function.

5. Rename `continent` to `cont`.

## `arrange()`

1. Order by year.

2. Order by year, in descending order.

3. Order by year, then by life expectancy.

## Piping, `%>%`

Note: think of `%>%` as the word "then"!

1. Combine `select()` Task 1 with `arrange()` Task 3.

## `filter()`

1. Only take data with population greater than 100 million.

2. Of those, only take data from Asia.

## git stuff (Optional)

Knit, commit, push!

# Break/Challenge: metaprogramming

Here's an activity for you to do during the break, in case you're all caught up. It should help you understand metaprogramming a bit more.

Suppose you're the instructor of an R programming course. You write an assignment question to evaluate whether students can write an `if` statement, for which an answer to the question looks something like this:

```
my_commute <- 60
if (my_commute > 30) {
    print("That's a long commute!")
} else {
    print("That's a short commute.")
}
```

Your task is to use metaprogramming to check whether a response (like the one above) works and contains an `if` statement. You should roughly follow these steps, using [adv-r: expressions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html) as a resource (especially Section 18.1).

1. Wrap the above block of code in the `expr()` function from the `rlang` package.
2. Use the `eval()` function to execute the code, to see if the code runs.
3. Use the `as.character()` function to check whether this response contains an `if` statement.

# Relational/Comparison and Logical Operators in R

1. Find all entries of Canada and Algeria occuring in the '60s. 

2. Find all entries of Canada, and entries of Algeria occuring in the '60s. 
3. Find all entries _not_ including Canada and Algeria.

# Bonus Exercises

If there's time remaining, we'll practice with these three exercises. I'll give you 1 minute for each, then we'll go over the answer.

1. Take all countries in Europe that have a GDP per capita greater than 10000, and select all variables except `gdpPercap`. (Hint: use `-`).

2. Take the first three columns, and extract the names.

3. Of the `iris` data frame, take all columns that start with the word "Petal". 
    - Hint: take a look at the "Select helpers" documentation by running the following code: `?tidyselect::select_helpers`.
    - Exercise from [r-exercises](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/10/19/dplyr-basic-functions-exercises/).
